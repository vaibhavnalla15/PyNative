Hello there! How are you doing today?
I just wanted to say hello again.
It's always nice to say hello and spread some cheer.
HELLO! Did you hear me?
Some people say hello once, others say hello five times in a row.
Anyway, this is just a random hello-filled paragraph for practice.
hello, Hello, and again... hello!
