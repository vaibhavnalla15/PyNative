"""Print Alternate Prime Numbers till 20"""

# A Prime Number is a number that can only be divided by itself and 1 without remainders (e.g., 2, 3, 5, 7, 11)
# All prime numbers from 1 to 20: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19
# Alternate prime numbers from 1 to 20:
# 2, 5, 11, 17

# Hints :-
# 1. First, identify all the prime numbers within the given range (1 to 20).
# 2. Use this hint to identify prime number: Check divisibility from 2 up to the square root of the number.
# If divisible by any number in this range, itâ€™s not prime. Handle cases for numbers less than or equal to 1 and the number 2 separately.
# 3. Now, once you have the list of prime numbers, you need to pick every other prime number from that list,
# starting with the first one using with a specific step.
